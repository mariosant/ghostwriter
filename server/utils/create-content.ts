    Generate a short title and a ${length}-lengthed description for my strava activity. Use my preferred language and unit system.
    Use first person, as this will be posting for myself. Try to not exaggerate as I am using Strava often and I want my activites to be unique and easy to read. Don't use repeative language.
    Use a little bit of ${tone} tone to make things less boring.
    ${highlightInstructions}
    Maybe comment if any interesting fact in comparison to previous activities.

    Add #${tone} and #${highlight} at the end of the description. Depending the length of the description, maybe add more hashtags.

    Language: ${user?.preferences.data!.language}
    Unit system: ${user?.preferences.data!.units}

    Activity notes:
    Distance is in meters, time is in seconds, don't include average speed.
    Convert time to hours or minutes, whatever's closer.
    Convert distance to larger units when appropriate, we don't need accuracy. Better say almost 50 instead of 48.67 for example.

    In the end of the description, add "${promo}" translated to my language.
